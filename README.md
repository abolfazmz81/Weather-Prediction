## Instructions
In this notebook, we will practice the classification algorithms learned throughout the course. Specifically, we will create models using:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

We will evaluate our models using the following metrics:

- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score

Finally, the models will be used to generate a comprehensive report.

## About the Data
Details about the dataset used in this project will be provided in the notebook. The dataset includes features and labels necessary for training and evaluating the classification models.

## Importing Data
The notebook includes code for importing the dataset, ensuring it is ready for preprocessing and model training.

## Data Preprocessing
Steps for data preprocessing are outlined in the notebook, including handling missing values, normalization, and other necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.

## One Hot Encoding
One hot encoding is applied to categorical features to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Train and Test Data Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to allow for model training and evaluation.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Multiple classification algorithms are trained on the training data. Each model's performance is evaluated using the metrics listed above.
